                <h1>From Printing Press to CSS</h1>
                <h4>October 19, 2015</h4>
                <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Printer_in_1568-ce.png" alt="Olde Printing Press" class="sidebar-pic">In the beginning, Johannes Gutenberg worked alone.</p>
                <p>The printing press was a pretty great idea and he wasn’t ready to share it. He split his work day in two, laying out his movable type blocks in the morning, and dedicating the afternoon to printing pages. His first-run bibles looked great and sold well.</p>
                <p>“Gutenberg Book Shoppe Hits Record Sales,” read the headlines of the hand-copied newspapers of the day.</p>
                <p>As the company grew, Gutenberg sought to expand, adding another press and two employees. One of the craftsmen maintained the presses, Gutz #1 and Gutz #2, and the other toiled on texts, laying out the many pages of the Old and New Testaments. With help in place, Gutenberg could now devote time to his social media marketing, while issuing senior management decisions as needed.</p>
                <p>For example, each day ended with a box full of letters that needed to return to production. Some needed the attention of the press master, others the attention of the text master. Johannes needed a creative solution to keep the letters straight and send them to the right craftsmen’s workbench.</p>
                <p>Times have changed since movable type ruled the day, but the job of sharing information with others has only become more complicated. The Web has opened new opportunities for sharing pictures of food, but it also requires many talented craftspeople to communicate successfully. Some to build and maintain the structures, and some to shape and beautify our words.</p>
                <p>As in Gutenberg’s day, it is helpful to divide the job duties, and modern technology helps us to do just that. All HTML has unseen code words that the computer deciphers. Some of that code gives instructions on how to display the page, such as this text is red, or this headline is big. Another part of the code facilitates the actions we take online, like submit the info I typed in this box when I click that button.</p>
                <p>Gutenberg solved his problem by using two boxes. One to hold letters that needed fixing by the press master, and another for type to be cleaned and resorted by the text master. Each box was sent to one workbench or the other to keep production humming and the fancy books coming.</p>
                <p>On the web, we similarly have two boxes, which we call ID and Class. Well that’s not true. Actually we can have as many boxes as there are cat pictures online, but there are two <em>kinds</em> of boxes that we use.</p>
                <p>One of our web craftsmen puts content into ID boxes. For example, he puts the lead paragraph of a web page into an ID box called “important_thought,” which can be controlled with a technology called Javascript. He can use lots of boxes, but each one is very small so he uses it only once on a page.</p>
                <p>The other web craftsperson prefers bigger boxes, that can hold several things at once. These Class boxes have names like “funny-pictures” that can be controlled with Cascading Stylesheets to make them bigger, add a red border, or create a nifty box shadow in the back. She has a knack for colors and typefaces, so her Class boxes enhance the presentation of our page.</p>
                <p>Each of our craftspeople work in coffee shops in different parts of town, so they try not to interfere with each other’s box names. ID box names tend to use an underscore, while Class boxes have a hyphen. Each of our web pages can use an ID like “important_thought” only once, while we can sprinkle the “funny-pictures” Class name all over the page if we want. Following those rules in place can help keep the development team happy, just like Gutenberg would have wanted.</p>
