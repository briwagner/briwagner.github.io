    # How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

    I enjoyed wireframing with my pair. She had not done the other challenges yet, to set up an index or blog index, so I helped her through that. I think it would have been less productive to have asked her to look at my files, as she hadn't gone through the material yet. So I felt a little bit like a tutor, which may not be the intended goal of the pairing challenge. But I feel it helps reinforce the lesson material for both of us. And I hope it helps me practice being a good partner.

    # Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

    Wireframing is definitely helpful, because it forces you to go through the steps that you take for granted. Or that I take for granted. Especially on a small project like this, the inclination is to jump in, using the assumptions you have about the final design. But when a visual example is in front of you, you realize that some assumptions are not going to work, or that you need to fine-tune a layout choice. In most cases, what seems like a daunting challenge -- a time-consuming rehearsal of drawing wireframe boxes -- is actually a pretty quick process. And in the end you have a reference to use as you move forward.

    # What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

    I think my pair and I wanted to make good choices about using semantic HTML tags. We also agreed to use placeholder text and file names for the template. We didn't discuss it openly. But I think we agreed that a good wireframe should outline the sections of the site, without belaboring too many details.

    # What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

    My pair taught me about <main>. I still need to see more examples to understand how best practices work in the field.
