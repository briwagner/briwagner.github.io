    summary: "Like paths in the woods, we have a choice to make when it comes time to search. Yes, Google or Bing. But also what kind of search we perform. We're talking about linear search and binary search, so read on, if you choose.",

    summary: "Looping is central to what computers do. This is a good thing to know, so I'll say it again. Looping is central to what computers do. Different computer languages do this in different ways, but all with the same goal: to loop. Now, Ruby has its own clever ways to do this, and the most simple is to just do the same thing over and over again.",

    title: "Take Playing Cards to Class",
    summary: "Classes are a great way in Ruby and other languages to emulate the real world. Why? Because things in the real world are messy, they don't fit into neat little packages of uniform size. Take my dog, Hazel. I cannot begin to describe her as an array. Any code code fails to convey the complexity that is my little dog. Even simple things, like a pack of playing cards defy such simple structures. Sure, playing cards have ranks from 2 to Ace. But then there are four different suits. And two different colors. And heaven help us from having to account for the Jacks with one eye showing and the ones with two eyes showing!",

    title: "24 Frames a Second",
    summary: "Everyone loves movies. Great actors, locations, music and effects all captured at 24 frames a second. That's fancy movie-speak for how the camera works, capturing an image every 1/24th of a second. In the old days, we called a movie a 'picture,' and that's closer to the reality, but it's really a whole lot of pictures, one after another. So with that knowledge, imagine you're a movie professional. The director says we just shot 10 seconds of a scene, and now it's up to you to calculate exactly how many pictures we have, okay? 24 * 10 = 240 pictures, or frames in fancy movie-speak. Good. Next day on the job, George Lucas walks in and tells you and the effects department to fix the color of the wall in the scene with R2D2, which they just shot. If it's the same 10-second shot, that's easy, right? 240 frames. And that's 240 little pictures we need to fix. Can you imagine photoshopping 240 pictures? Ugh, making movies is hard work.",

    title: "What's on Your Keychain?",
    summary: "My kids think I'm obsessive about my keys. Sometimes riding bikes, my kids will see me pat my rear pocket periodically to make sure my keys are still there. 'Pops, your keys are fine.' I dropped them down an elevator shaft one time, so allow me some leeway. Anyway, I have a few keys, not a ton, like a janitor or a roadie for a rockband. To those guys, keys are life. The little gold one opens the bus, the medium bronze one opens the mic cabinet, the big silver one is for the beer locker. I'm just speculating what a rock band needs to lock up. So when someone yells, 'Hey, Jessie, open up the tour bus,' then Jesse's hand swings instinctively to the pocket where his keys are and grabs 'em. Whenever he grabs for his keys, he knows where they are, and what they do: they open stuff.",

    summary: "In the beginning, Johannes Gutenberg worked alone. The printing press was a pretty great idea and he wasnâ€™t ready to share it. He split his work day in two, laying out his movable type blocks in the morning, and dedicating the afternoon to printing pages. His first-run bibles looked great and sold well.'Gutenberg Book Shoppe Hits Record Sales,'' read the headlines of the hand-copied newspapers of the day. As the company grew, Gutenberg sought to expand, adding another press and two employees. One of the craftsmen maintained the presses, Gutz #1 and Gutz #2, and the other toiled on texts, laying out the many pages of the Old and New Testaments. With help in place, Gutenberg could now devote time to his social media marketing, while issuing senior management decisions as needed.",

    summary: "Version control is like living for today and not giving up the past. Version control is when each of us gets our own way, and the group stays happy. Version control is being in two places at once.As if that wasn't crystal clear, let's add that version control is how developer teams all stay on top of the game, even when people are doing their own thing. It allows individuals to work on a project without slowing down or affecting the work of others. It allows bugs to be quickly identified and isolated. It allows people in different places to work at their speed and in disparate directions, while still pushing toward the same goal. It allows great minds to work at their best, without the technology getting in the way.",
