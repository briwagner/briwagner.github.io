#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I tried using the 'em' values as suggested, but I got frustrated. I'm used to % with width and margins, and I'm used to how those work together when doing responsive design. The 'em' does not behave similarly, so I tried and failed and ultimately returned to using %. Otherwise, my understanding is that margin and border exist outside the width of a div box, e.g., while padding affects everything inside it.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I tried using relative positions on a few elements and I had success. I'm not used to trying that, but after using it in the pair challenge I gave it a go. I still don't see a lot of opportunity for using position:fixed and the others normally. Generally, I'm used to a relatively loose positioning scheme with a bit of space between elements. When I look at websites with tight margins between many elements, I get sweaty.

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Getting a simple two-column layout was much harder than usual, because I was trying to use 'em' for a few size values. I was happy with the color palette, mainly because I had done that in the previous step before I touched the html files. I definitely like separating the tasks to keep the focus on the task at hand. I find it easy to work with text elements, to control size, color and padding values.

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned I don't know enough about how 'em's work. I learned it's best to probably avoid adding styles to the semantic tags. I reminded myself how much I use div's all over the place. But mostly I saw the big value in sticking to the suggested rule of one-rule per CSS class. It seems a bit verbose when writing the html files, but it avoids so much of the "search and fix" when you add a class with multiple rules and it behaves unexpectedly.
