            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Brian. This site is something I'm developing as part of a curriculum with Dev Bootcamp. Web dev is just the next adventure for me, after a career as a journalist. I spent time living in Brazil and traveling around other parts of Latin America, while reporting stories for different outlets. Check out the photos below and learn something about where I've been and what I've done.</p>

                <h3 class="article-padding">Reporter</h3>
                <p class="article-padding">I spent 12 some years as a reporter, starting on the radio and winding up in front of a TV camera. Being a journalist is a pretty exciting. You get to rub shoulders with powerful and important people, walk past the rope that holds back the crowds, and produce something that thousands of people may see every day. At the same time, I tried to never forget that when I went home at the end of the day, there's a difference between me and those important people even if we stood in the same room together. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Williams">See more.</a></p>
                <p class="article-padding">Journalism provided me two great skills that I use every day. Writing every day for a diverse audience forces you to be clear, concise and precise. And journalists are constantly sifting through tons of information to find the one important nugget that someone else might find of interest. Ask any journo, and they'll tell you what's interesting and what's NOT.</p>

                <h3 class="article-padding">Iraq</h3>
                <p class="article-padding">I had the privilege of traveling to Iraq to help film and produce a documentary in Arabic with a group of Iraqi journalists. It's a fascinating place where I met many kind, gentle people. Sadly it remains wracked by trouble.</p>
                <p class="article-padding">I coughed my way through two sandstorms in Baghdad. We also went to Basra. I only wish we could have traveled more, but it's not easy to get around there.</p>

                <h3 class="article-padding">Brazil</h3>
                <p class="article-padding">My first adventure in Latin America was in Chile, which I loved. But I found my true love in Brazil, a big wonderful country that was home for a couple of years. It's a beautiful place full of lovely people who are so welcoming. You should really visit, if you can.</p>
                <p class="article-padding">More than samba and soccer, Brazil is as diverse as the U.S. Ever hear of Americana? It's a community partly founded by Southerners so upset by the result of the U.S. Civil War they packed up and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana,_S%C3%A3o_Paulo">moved to Brazil.</a> </p>
                <p class="article-padding">Germans also headed to Brazil many decades ago, settling in southern Brazil where they retain some of the traditions from the homeland. One of those is Oktoberfest, which is colorfully celebrated in towns like Brusque. Say that like you say the beverage. Brewski.</p>

                <h3 class="article-padding">Chicago</h3>
                <p class="article-padding">Only when I left the country did I start telling people that I was from Chicago. Of course, the dyed-in-the-wool Chicagoans would dispute that entirely. But there's little point trying to explain to someone who's never set foot in the U.S. that the northern suburbs of Chicago are the same but <em>different</em>  from the Windy City.</p>
                <p class="article-padding">Still, I love the Midwestern autumns and more so the winters, and missed them when I was away. I'm looking forward to spending winter 2015 with the Island Foxes at DBC Chicago. It seems somehow cruel that the cohort name invokes island during the winter time ...</p>
